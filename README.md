# Banana Quiz

Banana Quiz is a free browser counting game. A bunch of bananas appears, you type
how many you can see, and correct answers earn points, streaks and achievements.
It is built with a React/Vite client and an Express/MongoDB server.

## Project Structure

- `client/` - React frontend powered by Vite
- `server/` - Express backend (Passport sessions, MongoDB via Mongoose)
- `docs/` - Project documentation

## Getting Started

### Client

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

The Vite development server will print the local URL in the terminal
(`http://localhost:5173` by default). It proxies `/auth` and `/api` to the server.

### Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev      # Start with nodemon
# or
npm start        # Start with Node
```

Create a `server/.env` file based on `server/.env.example` before starting the server.

## Available Server Commands

From `server/`:

```bash
npm run dev      # Start the development server with nodemon
npm start        # Start the server
npm run lint     # Run Oxlint
npm test         # Run the test suite
```

## Available Client Commands

From `client/`:

```bash
npm run dev      # Start the development server
npm run build    # Create a production build
npm run lint     # Run Oxlint
npm run preview  # Preview the production build
```

## Pages

| Route | Access | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/` | Public | Landing page with features, modes, achievements, FAQ and a live leaderboard preview |
| `/login` | Public | Sign in, create an account, or continue with Google/Facebook |
| `/forgot-password` | Public | Request a single-use password reset link |
| `/reset-password?token=…` | Public | Choose a new password from a valid reset link |
| `/dashboard` | Signed in | Post-login hub: player status, mode picker, audio controls, achievements preview |
| `/play?mode=classic\|blitz\|zen` | Signed in | The counting game |
| `/achievements` | Signed in | Full achievement cabinet with progress filters |
| `/leaderboard` | Public | Global rankings |
| `/profile` | Signed in | Account details, preferences, password, devices and login history |

A successful sign-in redirects to `/dashboard`.

## Player accounts

Players can sign up and sign in in two ways:

- **Email + password** on `/login` (the Create Account tab). Passwords are hashed
  with bcrypt and never returned by the API. Single-word names are supported;
  first and last name are optional profile fields.
- **Google / Facebook OAuth** using the buttons on the same page.

### Auth endpoints

- `POST /auth/register` with `{ "name", "email", "password" }` — creates the
  account and starts a session. The password must pass the shared password policy.
- `POST /auth/login` with `{ "email", "password" }` — starts a session. Successful
  and failed attempts are both recorded in the player's login history.
- `POST /auth/forgot-password` with `{ "email" }` — creates a single-use reset
  token and emails a link when the account exists. The response is always the
  same so the endpoint cannot be used to discover registered emails.
- `GET /auth/reset-password/validate?token=…` — checks a reset token before the
  page asks for a new password.
- `POST /auth/reset-password` with `{ "token", "password" }` — sets the new
  password, marks the token used and signs out every existing session.
- `POST /auth/logout` — ends the session.
- `GET /auth/status` — returns `{ authenticated, user }` for the current session.
- `GET /auth/google` / `GET /auth/facebook` — begin the OAuth flow.

If an email is already linked to a social account, password login returns a
message telling the player to use Google or Facebook instead.

### Password policy

Registration, password changes and password resets all use
`server/src/utils/passwordPolicy.js`:

- At least 8 characters (12+ is marked as strong).
- At least three of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers and symbols.
- Not a well-known common password.
- Does not contain the player's name or email address.

The client mirrors these rules in `client/src/lib/passwordStrength.js`, so the
sign-up, reset and account-settings forms show a live strength meter and
checklist while the player types. The server remains authoritative.

### Password reset links

Reset links contain a 32-byte random token. Only a SHA-256 hash of the token is
stored, alongside a 30-minute expiry (`PASSWORD_RESET_TTL_MINUTES`). Tokens are
single-use, and requesting a new link invalidates any previous unused link.
Expired token documents are removed by MongoDB's TTL monitor.

When SMTP is not configured, the server logs the reset URL and, in development
only, returns it as `devResetUrl` so the flow can be tested locally. In
production, the link is never returned by the API.

Configure email delivery with the optional SMTP variables in
`server/.env.example`: `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_SECURE`, `SMTP_USER`,
`SMTP_PASS` and `MAIL_FROM`.

### Account endpoints

All account endpoints require an authenticated session.

- `GET /api/users/me` — profile plus current stats.
- `PATCH /api/users/me` — update `name`, `bio` (max 160 chars), `avatar` (http(s)
  URL), `favoriteMode` (`classic`, `blitz`, `zen`) and `preferences`
  (`reducedMotion`, `showOnLeaderboard`).
- `PATCH /api/users/me/password` — set or change the password. Existing passwords
  require `currentPassword`; social-only accounts can add one. The new password
  must pass the policy, and reusing the current password is rejected.
- `GET /api/users/me/security` — security score, checklist, password age, recent
  device count, failed attempts and last sign-in times.
- `POST /api/users/me/logout-others` — sign out every other device while keeping
  the current session.
- `GET /api/users/me/logins` — recent sign-in attempts and grouped devices,
  including the email used, success/failure, failure reason, browser, OS, masked
  IP and whether the attempt came from the current device.
- `GET /api/users/me/achievements` — achievement list, progress and summary.
- `GET /api/users/leaderboard?limit=25` — public rankings. Players who turn off
  `showOnLeaderboard` are excluded.

Login history is stored in a separate `LoginEvent` collection. Each event keeps
the email used, the sign-in method, whether the attempt succeeded and why it
failed, a parsed browser/OS label, a coarse device type and a SHA-256 hash of the
session id (never the raw cookie). The last 50 events per player are kept.
Failed attempts for unknown emails are stored without a player reference.

### Session security

Sessions carry the account's `authVersion`. Changing the password, resetting it
or choosing “Sign out other devices” increments that version, so any session with
an older value is rejected on its next request. A password change keeps the
current session signed in; a reset signs out every device. Password changes and
resets also send a notification email when SMTP is configured.

The API disables `x-powered-by`, uses Helmet security headers, masks IP addresses
in account history, rate-limits credential and password-reset endpoints, and
returns a generic response for forgot-password requests to prevent account
enumeration.

## Game modes

Modes are defined in `server/src/config/gameModes.js` and exposed publicly via
`GET /api/game/modes`.

| Mode | Time per puzzle | Points multiplier | Speed bonus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Classic | 120 s | 1× | Yes |
| Blitz | 30 s | 1.5× | Yes |
| Zen | 300 s | 1× | No |

### Game endpoints

- `GET /api/game/modes` — public list of modes.
- `POST /api/game/start` with `{ "mode": "classic" }` — starts a round and returns
  the puzzle image, time limit and mode.
- `POST /api/game/answer` with `{ "sessionId", "answer" }` — scores the answer and
  returns the solution, points and updated stats.
- `POST /api/game/expire` with `{ "sessionId" }` — ends a round whose timer ran
  out. The round is recorded as a played loss and the solution is returned.
- `GET /api/game/stats` — the signed-in player's stats.

A round that times out still counts as a played game, so win rate and per-mode
achievements stay accurate. The start response includes `serverNow` and
`remainingMs`, which the client uses to keep its countdown aligned with the
server clock.

### Scoring

A correct answer earns:

```
(base 100 + speed bonus) × streak multiplier × mode multiplier
```

- **Speed bonus**: up to 50 extra points, scaled by how far under the 10-second
  threshold the answer lands.
- **Streak multiplier**: `1 + 0.1 × current streak`, capped at 2×.
- **Mode multiplier**: 1.5× in Blitz, 1× elsewhere.

## Achievements

Fourteen achievements are evaluated on read from the player's stats — there is no
separate unlock bookkeeping. They cover first rounds and wins, streaks (3/10/25),
fast answers (under 5 s and 2 s), point milestones (500/2,500/10,000), games
played/won, and completing a Blitz or Zen round. Per-mode play counts are stored on
the score document so they survive game-session cleanup.

## Audio

Sound effects and background music are synthesised with the Web Audio API, so there
are no external MP3 files or CDN requests. The audio engine is a singleton that
keeps music playing across page changes. Browsers block audio until a user gesture,
so the first click, tap or keypress unlocks the context.

Settings (SFX on/off, music on/off, master volume) are stored in `localStorage`
under `bq-audio-settings` and can be changed from the header or the account page.
They are device-local rather than account-level.

## OAuth provider setup

For local development, configure the provider applications with these exact
callback URLs:

- Google: `http://localhost:3000/auth/google/callback`
- Facebook: `http://localhost:3000/auth/facebook/callback`

Set `CLIENT_URL` to the client URL (`http://localhost:5173`) and
`AUTH_CALLBACK_URL` to the server URL (`http://localhost:3000`). Facebook login
requests the `public_profile` permission; email is optional because some Facebook
applications do not grant the email permission.

## Development notes

Run the client and server in separate terminals. Keep secrets and local
configuration in `.env` files; these files are excluded from Git.

MongoDB Atlas can take a few seconds to accept the first connection, so the client
retries `/auth/status` once before treating a player as signed out.
